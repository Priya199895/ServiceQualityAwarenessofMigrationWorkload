Steps to be followed :-
I prompted our problem statement to chatgpt and it gave out the below steps, which makes a lot of sense to me as well. 
Your research problem statement focuses on the challenge of forecasting the influence of virtual machine migration, 
particularly in the context of migrating workloads to clients over the internet with energy 
efficiency in mind. It highlights the importance of developing a scheme and mechanism for reliably forecasting the 
impact of these migrations on applications running inside virtual environments in real-time. 
Additionally, it underscores the need to make relocation decisions based on various service quality metrics,
including those from the operating system or container.
To address this research problem, you can consider the following key components:

1. Real-time Measurement and Evaluation: Investigate methods and tools for real-time measurement and evaluation of service quality metrics during virtual machine migration. This may involve monitoring performance, responsiveness, security, and other relevant metrics.

2. Energy Efficiency: Explore strategies for optimizing energy efficiency during migration, especially when workloads are moved over the internet. This could involve resource allocation, power management, and energy-efficient data transmission.

3. Forecasting Models: Develop forecasting models that can predict the influence of migration on service quality. These models should take into account various factors, such as the characteristics of the applications, the network conditions, and the target environment.

4. Decision-Making Algorithms: Design decision-making algorithms that use the collected service quality metrics to make reliable relocation decisions. These algorithms should be capable of dynamically adapting to changing conditions.

5. Service Quality Awareness Framework: Create a framework that integrates all these components to enable a holistic approach to service quality awareness during migration. This framework should be adaptable to various scenarios and workloads.

6. Validation and Testing: Conduct extensive testing and validation of your forecasting models, decision-making algorithms, and the overall framework. Use real-world datasets and scenarios to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of your approach.

7. User Experience and Feedback: Incorporate user experience into your research by gathering feedback from end-users and clients who are affected by the migration decisions. This feedback can be valuable for refining your forecasting and decision-making processes.

8. Energy Efficiency Metrics: Develop specific energy efficiency metrics that can be used to assess the environmental impact of migrations and guide decisions that align with sustainability goals.

I would suggest that we take up one one topics each and start to research them over before our first meeting and then we can figure out a way to 
draw an architecture for this. I will come up with a rough architecture of our model and then we can start building upon it.
