# ServiceQualityAwarenessofMigrationWorkload
Investigate on how to reliably forecast the influence of migration on the quality of service inside virtual environments!

## Abstract
1. Paste ideas and findings around the topic, research papers, related tools, etc.
2. Highlight Weekly group discussions and leads.

## IndividualReports
1. Share the reports on the Sunday of every submission week.
2. It is better to read everyone's report and discuss it during calls.

## Organisation of Weekly Discussions - 1 hour
1. First 15 mins discuss recent findings and clarify doubts with each other. 
   Everyone shall use 2 mins to share what they found and then we do an open discussion.
2. Discuss the requirement and strategy. - 15mins
   Technological Requirements and tools to be used. Exercise with existing tools.
3. Use for developing the architechture of protoype.  - 30mins.

My summary and conclution from the paper “Efficient VM migrations using forecasting techniques in cloud computing” are as following:
The paper discusses efficient virtual machine (VM) migrations in cloud computing. It covers challenges and benefits, hypervisors and migration types, migration metrics and classification, network performance and cost, predictive models for VM migration, and ensemble methods. The main focus is on optimizing VM migrations in cloud data centers. Following are the main topics from the paper:
